Welcome to v0.1a, and happy Annual Roguelike Release Party!

The player's inventory has been overhauled.  Items now stack
with identical items, and the drop interface allows you to
select multiple items to drop in one go.  Dropping part of a
stack works as in nethack or DCSS--enter the number of items you
want to stack, then the letter assigned to that stack.

Another major new mechanic has been added: construction!  Right
now it's fairly new and untested, so please share bug reports.
It also only has a limited selection of terrain you can build;
more will be added soon.  Press * to construct.

Finally, you can craft and construct using items on the floor,
up to two tiles away.  This makes crafting things that require a
lot of items much easier!
